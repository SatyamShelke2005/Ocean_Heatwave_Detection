# 🌊 Ocean Heatwave Detection 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI-based system to detect and predict marine heatwaves using oceanographic and environmental data. The model is built from scratch using the Delta Rule (Widrow-Hoff Learning Algorithm), a supervised learning approach that updates weights using gradient-based optimization.

---

## 📂 Submission Format

Your submission must include this function:

```
def predict(X_train, y_train, X_test):
    return predictions
```

---

## 📜 Rules

* Do not modify `evaluate.py`
* Use the provided dataset only
* Follow the submission format strictly
* Submit only one model per PR

---

## ⚙️ Evaluation Process

Each Pull Request triggers an automated workflow:

1. Dataset is loaded
2. Your model is loaded
3. `predict()` function is executed
4. Performance metrics are calculated:

   * Accuracy
   * F1 Score
5. Leaderboard is updated automatically
